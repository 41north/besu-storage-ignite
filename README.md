<p align="center">Use Apache Ignite as your Key/Value store!</p>

## üí° Introduction

From Apache's Ignite website:

> Apache Ignite¬Æ is a horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant distributed in-memory computing platform for building real-time applications that can process terabytes of data with in-memory speed.

This plugin allows to use [Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) as the Key/Value storage mechanism for your Hyperledger Besu instance.

## üôà Usage

First, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:41north/besu-storage-ignite.git
```

Open IntelliJ, load the project and type the following in the terminal:

```sh
./gradlew generateIntellijRunConfigs
```

That will generate [Intellij's Run Configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) from the [`intellij-run-configs.yaml`](./intellij-run-configs.yaml) file with several useful commands (feel free to customize it as necessary).

After the run configs are generated, next type the following in the terminal:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

That will start Apache Ignite. Next is to start Besu with one network by launching one of the following run config:

- `BESU | Dev > Run`
- `BESU | Ropsten > Run`
- `BESU | Mainnet > Run`

After that, you will see Key/Value entries being populated to Apache Ignite.
