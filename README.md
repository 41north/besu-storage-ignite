<p align="center">Kick-start your next Besu plugin!</p>

## üí° Introduction

Do you want to create a [Besu plugin](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Plugins/) super fast? This template will help you get started!

What is included:

- generate fat `JARs` to distribute the plugin with ease.
- easily check if all the various Besu dependencies are up to date.
- ensure a consistent coding style with auto-formatting.

Whilst this project is mainly geared towards Kotlin it can still be used with plain old Java.

Bundled Gradle plugins:

- [`ShadowJar`](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow) - For creating fat `JARs`.
- [`Ktlint`](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle) - For automatic formatting of Kotlin code.
- [`Gradle Versions Plugin`](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin) - Determine which dependencies have updates
